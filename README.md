# IntroToDeepLearning

This is the GitHub repo for the 2018 AIS Intro to Deep Learning Workshop.

Please install the following software dependencies if you plan to run the code locally:

- **Anaconda** - distribution of Python with many useful ML and data science libraries.
- **TensorFlow** - popular deep learning library created by the Google Brain Team.
- **Keras** - a high-level deep learning library that runs on top of TensorFlow.

To install Anaconda please visit: https://www.anaconda.com/download/

After installing Anaconda, open your Terminal (on MacOS or Linux) or the Anaconda Prompt (on Windows)
and run the following commands to install **TensorFlow** and **Keras**:

- **TensorFlow**: **conda install tensorflow**
- **Keras**: **conda install keras**

Otherwise, you can run the code on Google Colab, which comes with all of the libraries installed, along with a GPU computing environment.

## Getting Started with Jupyter
Once you've installed all of the libraries, you can download or clone this GitHub repo and launch Jupyter
by opening up your terminal or Anaconda Prompt and typing the command **jupyter notebook**. You can also
go to your Anaconda navigator and launch Jupyter from there.
