    "# Intro to Deep Learning with Keras\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook contains code and explanations for the 2018 AIS Intro to Deep Learning workshop. This tutorial focuses on training neural networks to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Use This Notebook\n",
    "This notebook has several cells, some with markdown and others with runnable Python code. To run a cell, click on the cell and then use the **SHIFT + ENTER** keyboard shortcut or navigate to **Cell** in the top menu bar and click on **Run Cells** in the dropdown menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Software Prerequisites\n",
    "Make sure to install the following software/libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Anaconda** - Python distribution with many useful libraries\n",
    "- **TensorFlow** - deep learning library, acts as a backend for Keras\n",
    "- **Keras** - a high-level deep learning library that runs on top of TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "## Libraries Used\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Numpy** - for handling linear algebra and numerical computations in machine learning.\n",
    "- **Matplotlib** - for visualizing data, such as images.\n",
    "- **Keras** - features a simple API for deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## High-Level Overview of Supervised ML - Learning by Examples\n",
    "Supervised machine learning is all about training a model or algorithm to take a set of inputs and produce a desired set of outputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples\n",
    "- Training a model to predict the temperature for the next hour given the temperature for the past 10 hours.\n",
    "- Training a model to determine if an email is spam.\n",
    "- Training a model to determine if an image contains a dog, a cat, a plane, or a car.\n",
    "\n",
    "The supervised machine learning process always starts with training data, which has two components: **features** and one or more **targets**. The **features** are basically our **inputs**, which give our model some information that we want it to use to try to predict the **targets** or outputs. Our model uses this data to learn patterns in examples of **inputs or features** and **expected outputs or targets**. This is the **training phase** of supervised ML. During this phase, our ML algorithm, which could be a neural network, learns from **training examples** in the **training data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='./images/supervised_ml_training.png' height=\"400\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "After the training phase, the previously untrained ML algorithm is trained and ready to make predictions on **test data** given just the **inputs** and not the outputs. The **test data** is data that the algorithm has never seen before, and evaluating a model's performance on test data allows us to evaluate how it would perform with real-life data.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='./images/supervised_ml_test.png' height=\"400\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Supervised ML Problems\n",
    "- **Classification** - these problems are about predicting discrete categories or classes. For example, categorizing an email as spam or not spam is a classification task. Classification problems with two classes are called **binary classification problems**.\n",
    "- **Regression** - these problems are about predicting continuous values. For example, predicting stock prices is a regression problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About the MNIST Dataset - Recognizing Handwritten Digits\n",
    "The goal of this exercise is to train a neural network to recognize handwritten digits using the famous MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset contains a **training set with 60,000 labeled 28 x 28 pixel images** of the 10 digits and a **test set with 10,000 images**. In this dataset, information contained in the images, such as the values of each pixel form our **features** and the labels, which are numbers corresponding to the digit in each image, are our **targets** that we want the neural network to predict.\n",

    "Deep learning and machine learning in general involves dealing with matrices and vectors since data is often represented with these structures. In fact, as we will see in the next section of this notebook, images can be represented as matrices, with each pixel forming a single element within the matrix. The **dot product** and **matrix multiplication** operations also occur frequently in deep learning. In fact, for really large datasets we need high-performance computers for deep learning because **matrix multiplication is computationally expensive**. We don't need to know how to do these operations by hand because software libraries will take care of that for us, but we should still be aware of these operations."

    "As we mentioned before neural networks are **biologically inspired** models. For a moment, let's forget about machine learning and review how the human nervous system works to understand where the concept of neural networks came from. A **neuron**, the fundamental unit of this system, looks something like this:\n",

    "### Key Parts of the Neuron\n",
    "A neuron transmits electrical signals that are constantly activated as the human brain learns and recognizes new concepts. The main parts of a neuron that we should take note of are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **inputs** - the neuron receives several input signals through **dendrites** from connections to neighboring neurons. \n",
    "- **synapses** - gaps between **axons** and **dendrites**. Synapses transfer signals between neurons.\n",
    "- **body** - the neuron has a cell body that receives all of the incoming signals.\n",

    "### The Simplest Neural Network - The Perceptron\n",
    "The perceptron, arguably the simplest neural network, was invented by psychologist Frank Rosenblatt in 1957 and looks something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='./images/perceptron.png' width=\"400\" height=\"200\"/>\n",
    "(image source: http://ataspinar.com/2016/12/22/the-perceptron/)\n",
    "\n",
    "A perceptron is basically a neural network with a single **artificial neuron**. Similar to the biological neuron, a perceptron has the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **inputs** - the perceptron receives a given number of real-valued inputs (the inputs are numbers).\n",
    "- **weights** - the perceptron has a weight $ w_i $ associated with each input $ x_i $. These weighted connections are like synapses and they are parameters that the perceptron must \"learn\".\n",
    "- **weighted sum (basically a dot product)** - the inputs are multiplied by the weights and the results are added together to produce a weighted sum.\n",
    "- **activation function** - the perceptron has an activation function called the unit-step function that produces an output of 1 if the weighted sum is greater than some threshold $\\theta$ and -1 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Math Behind the Perceptron Output\n",
    "Given a vector of inputs $x = (x_0, x_1, ..., x_n) $, a set of weights $w = (w_0, w_1, ..., w_n) $, and an activation threshold $\\theta$ the output of a perceptron is given by the following function:\n",

    "The Perceptron is designed to solve **binary classification problems**. By learning the best weights for a given problem, the Perceptron can be used to classify a set of inputs into one of two possible outputs. However, the Perceptron is very limited in scope because not only is it limited to solving binary classification problems, but it can only find the optimal weights for **linearly separable** binary classification problems. These are problems where a straight line or multi-dimensional hyperplane can simply separate the two classes.\n",

    "### Deep Neural Networks - Densely Connected Hidden Layers\n",
    "Deep neural networks are much more complex than the simple perceptron and feature multiple layers of neurons and several **densely connected hidden layers** between the input and output layers. Here is what a deep neural network looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='./images/deep_net.png' width=\"500\" height=\"250\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the example above we can see that the neural network has an **input layer** with **three inputs**, two **hidden layers**, and an **output layer** with a **single output**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a densely connected layer?\n",
    "In a densely connected layer, each neuron from the group of neurons on the left is connected to every other neuron from the group of neurons on the right. In the example above, **hidden layer 1** is densely connected because every neuron from the **input layer** is connected to every neuron in **hidden layer 1**. Each connection between the layers has a numerical weight attached to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example with real numbers. Notice that the value in each of the output neurons is the **weighted sum** of the values from the **incoming inputs**.\n",
    "\n",
    " <img src='./images/hidden_layer_example.png' width=\"400\" height=\"200\"/>\n",
    " \n",
    " The computation that we did above is basically just a matrix multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "#### The Sigmoid Activation Function\n",
    "After multiplying the weights from the input layer by the inputs and computing the sum in each output neuron we still have one more step left to do, and that is applying an activation function to the outputs. In the Perceptron example, we used a unit-step function as our activation function, but for deep neural networks, we can introduce another activation function, called the **sigmoid or logistic function**. The function is defined mathematically by the following equation:\n",
    " \n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\phi (z) = \\frac {1} {1+e^{-z}}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "What's special about this function is that it is really useful for representing **probabilities** since it takes **any real number as input** and **outputs a value between 0 and 1**. Take a look at a graph of the function below to see what this concept looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='./images/sigmoid_graph.png' width=\"400\" height=\"300\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to apply the **sigmoid activation function** to our hidden layer in the previous example, the final values would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='./images/sigmoid_activation_applied.png' width=\"400\" height=\"300\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Softmax Activation Function\n",
    "Another activation function, which we usually see at the final or output layer of neural networks is the **softmax activation function**. Unlike the sigmoid activation function, which takes a single value as input, the **softmax function** takes a **vector as input** and produces a **vector of the same shape as the output**. In a way, this function basically acts on an entire layer. The softmax function basically converts a vector of real values into a **probability distribution** and is useful for representing the probabilities of different classes. This function is defined mathematically below:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a vector $z = (z_{1}, z_{2}, ..., z_{n})$, the result of applying softmax $\\sigma(z)$, is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sigma(z)_{i} = \\frac{e^{z_{i}}}{\\sum_{j=1}^n e^{z_{j}}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In **plain english**, what the equation above really means is that to get the softmax of a vector, **we raise $e$ to the power of each value in the vector and sum up the results**. Then for each value, **we raise $e$ to the power of that value and divide it by this sum**. This process guarantees that all of the values will **sum up to 1**. (Note that the natural constant $e$, is approximately equal to 2.71828)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### An Example with Real Numbers \n",
    "If we took the values from our output layer in the previous example before applying sigmoid and instead applied softmax, we would calculate the softmax as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Our input vector is $z = \\begin{bmatrix} 3 & 1.5 & 6 \\end{bmatrix}$. If we calculate the sum of raising $e$ to the power of each value, we get $e^3 + e^{1.5} + e^6 \\approx 427.996$. Now for each value we just raise $e$ to the power of that value and divide it by our previous sum. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{e^{3}}{427.996} \\approx 0.04692926$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{e^{1.5}}{427.996} \\approx 0.01047133$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{e^{6}}{427.996} \\approx 0.94259941$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So the final result is $\\sigma(z) = \\begin{bmatrix} 0.04692926 & 0.01047133 & 0.94259941\\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Softmax??\n",
    "Softmax is useful because it allows us to represent probabilities. In our problem, we have ten possible digits that an image can correspond to. Sometimes there is a little bit of uncertainty involved in the category that an image belongs to and even humans can see this when we can't tell if someone has drawn a one or a seven. For this problem, we want our neural network to produce not one but **ten outputs** with each output corresponding to the **probability** of an image corresponding to a specific digit. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining the Structure of a Neural Network for the MNIST Problem\n",
    "Now that we understand the parts of a deep neural network, we can design one for our problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inputs\n",
    "Each image in the dataset is 28 x 28 pixels. Because the input for deep neural networks that we have described must vectors, we will have to flatten each image from 28 x 28 pixels to a vector of 784 pixel values. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='./images/MNIST-flatten.png' height=\"400\" width=\"600\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hidden Layers\n",
    "Our input layer contains 784 values. We can stack two hidden layers together after this input layer, with the first one having 784 neurons and the second one having 800 neurons. We can add a sigmoid activation to each layer. After this our network design looks something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='./images/inputs+hidden_layers.png' height=\"400\" width=\"600\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Softmax Output\n",
    "Finally, we can add a densely connected output layer with 10 neurons and apply a softmax activation to it. The final network design looks like this:\n",

This is where loss functions come in. A loss function is basically a function that takes two arguments - some predicted values and the correct values, and measures **how bad** the predictions are.

Clearly, we want to predict the highest probability for the correct digit and lower probabilities for incorrect digits. The **categorical cross entropy** function allows us to quantify the difference between the assigned probabilities and the actual labels. \n",

    "**Gradient descent** is one of the simplest optimization algorithms and usually the first one that most people studying deep learning actually learn about. To understand the idea behind this algorithm picture a scenario where you are **walking through a valley** and you are trying to get to the **lowest point** in the valley.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='./images/valley.jpg' height=\"200\" width=\"300\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, it would make sense to look at where the path in front of you is headed and keep walking downhill rather than uphill to try to reach the bottom of the valley. This is sort of how gradient descent works. If we relate this concept back to the **universal deep learning problem**, the valley becomes the **graph of our cost function** and we can use a little bit of calculus to figure out if the cost function is going **downhill** or **uphill**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Math Review - Derivatives\n",
    "If we want reach the **bottom of the valley** or the **minimum value** of our **cost function**, we have to know whether our cost function is currently decreasing or increasing and **how fast** this decrease or increase is occurring. **Derivatives** allow us to actually do this. Finding the **derivative** of a function is like finding the slope of that function at an instantaneous point. Imagine that you are riding a bike or driving a car and at exactly 4:00 pm you use a speedometer to find your velocity. The reading on the speedometer at that split second is basically your **instantaneous velocity**. This is different from calculating an **average velocity** by calculating the distance traveled between 4:00 pm and 6:00 pm and dividing this distance by the elapsed time.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Weight Updates Using Derivatives with Gradient Descent\n",
    "Let's say that we have a loss function $ L(w) $ that we can define in terms of the weights $ w $ in our neural net. Then for each training sample where we make predictions and find the loss $ L $, the gradient descent algorithm updates each weight $ w_{i} $ by an amount $ \\Delta w_{i} $ :\n",

    "...where $\\ell$ is a parameter called the **learning rate**. This parameter controls how much the weights get updated during each iteration. Typical values are less than 1, for example $ \\ell = 0.01$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a moment to understand what is going on in the update rule above. The expression $ \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w_{i}} $ tells us how much the loss is changing and what direction it is moving in (think going downhill vs. going uphill). There are three basic cases for updating the weights:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Case 1: Cost Function is Going Downhill at Given Point**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case $ \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w_{i}} < 0$. This means that increasing the weight $w_{i}$ will likely cause the **loss function to decrease**. In this case, this also means that $\\Delta w_{i} > 0$ which means we will **increase the weight** $w_{i}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Case 2: Cost Function is Going Uphill at Given Point**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case $ \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w_{i}} > 0$. This means that increasing the weight $w_{i}$ will likely cause the **loss function to increase**. In this case, this also means that $\\Delta w_{i} < 0$ which means we will do the opposite and **decrease the weight** $w_{i}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Case 3: Cost Function is Not Changing at Given Point**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case $ \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w_{i}} = 0$. Going back to the analogy of the valley, this likley means that we are at the bottom of the valley, a flat point where we are neither going downhill nor uphill. So in this case we **don't change the weight** because $\\Delta w_{i} = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we are not performing weight updates using all of the data at once for training but instead selecting **random training examples** or **batches** from the data. For this reason, the gradient descent algorithm described in this section is often called **stochastic gradient descent** or **SGD**.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "As the ball rolls down the hill it picks up enough momentum to basically overcome local minima. What if we added this concept of momentum to SGD?! This is exactly the reasoning behind the SGD + momentum approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mathematical Definition of SGD with Momentum\n",
    "Recall that in regular SGD we had the following weight update rule for a weight $w$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta w = -\\ell \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can write this a little differently, with $w_{t+1}$ being the **new weight** at iteration $t+1$ and $w_{t}$ being the **old weight**.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ w_{t+1} = w_{t} - \\ell \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w_{t}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with SGD + momentum we add another term called a **momentum term**, $m$, that also gets updated at each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ m_{t+1} = \\rho m_{t} + \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w_{t}} $$\n",
    "$$ w_{t+1} = w_{t} - \\ell m_{t+1} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first equation $\\rho$ is another parameter often referred to as **friction**. It controls how much the momentum decays over time. A typical value is $\\rho = 0.9$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Optimization Algorithms\n",
    "There are many other optimization algorithms used in deep learning but we won't cover them all in great detail because they are out of the scope of this workshop. Some of the most common algorithms include:\n",

    "The **convolutional layer** is the fundamental unit of CNNs. This layer passes over local two-dimensional regions in the image and performs a **convolution** operation on each region.

These large layers are good at learning patterns but can sometimes learn them too well, to the point where they memorize features unique to the training data and fail to generalize to the validation data. This is called **overfitting**. We can control overfitting by introducing **dropout** into these final layers. With **dropout**, during training we randomly remove the effect of certain neurons by **setting their activations to zero**. Note that this is just as good as removing these neurons temporarily. This prevents the network from relying too much on a few specific features and forces it to learn general patterns. We can specify the probability of dropping neurons in dropout layers in Keras.\n",
